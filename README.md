Team 404 Found Us is developing an AI-powered dashboard to make NASAâ€™s bioscience publications easier to explore and understand. Over decades, NASA has conducted hundreds of biology experiments in space, producing valuable research that can be difficult to navigate.

This tool enables users to quickly search and summarize key findings from each study, highlighting the results and impacts of space biology experiments. By transforming complex scientific content into clear, accessible insights, it helps identify areas of scientific progress, knowledge gaps, and opportunities for future research.

The project supports the next era of human space exploration by making decades of research more usable and actionable. Scientists, mission planners, and educators can more efficiently uncover critical information to inform decisions, plan safe missions to the Moon and Mars, and accelerate discoveries that will shape the future of space exploration.
